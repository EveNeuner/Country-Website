        <p>
            There is a legend that says that you'll return to Rome if <br>
            you toss a coin into the Trevi. Not suprisingly, many tourists <br>
            toss coins into the fountain, in total about €3,000 every day. <br>
            This adds to about €1,000,000 every year, which is all donated. <br>
